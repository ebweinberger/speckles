# Speckles

Speckles is a small artisitc project that I made to help me learn p5js and vercel. You can visit it at [speckles.now.sh](http://speckles.now.sh)!



## Tehcnologies

p5js is a JavaScript library with a focus on creative use. I plan to use this libary to make an attractive frontend for the social media heat map that I am making.

Vercel is a platform that let me host the static webpage easily. I plan to use it for future projects so this was a good introduction to it.
